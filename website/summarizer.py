It features fresh translations, numerous illustrations (ancient and modern) of classical myths and legends, and commentary that emphasizes the anthropological, historical, religious, sociological, and economic contexts in which the myths were told. This book covers myths of creation, myths of fertility, myths of the Olympians, Heracles, Oedipus, Trojan War, Roman Myth, Odysseus, and more. It also introduces students to classic literary works by Homer, Hesiod, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Ovid. For anyone interested in learning more about the creation and modern interpretation of classical myths."

The NFL is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada and the highest professional level of American football in the world.[5] Each NFL season begins annually with a three-week preseason in August, followed by the 18-week regular season, which runs from early September to early January, with each team playing 17 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, seven teams from each conference, including four division winners and three wild card teams, advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament, which culminates in the Super Bowl, played in early February between the winners of the AFC and NFC championship games."
